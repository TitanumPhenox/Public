  <h1>
    To the one person I care deply about
  </h1>
  <h2>
    I know that I haven't been the best and haven't been there. I know that I should have called you and that I should have just been in your life more. I know that I have made you sad and I hate the thought of that. Honestly I have just wanted things to go back to the way that they were. The good times that we used to have when we would stay up talking about the most random crap. I wanted to tell you that I love you so much and I hate the thought of you thinking about me so much. I know that I haven't been the best but I am going through alot and I want you to know that I will be okay I just need sometime to be alone and think about the decisions I have made. I am sorry that if I have made you think that any of this mess is your fault. I am pretty bad with saying things when it comes to me being really hurt by people. 
  </h2>
  <h3> I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive what I have done. I understand if you don't want to be my friend. I want you to know I still love you so much and I don't want that to change. I love you so much <3- Tyler.
  </h3>
